LearniChat: A Chatbot That Learns from Users
LearniChat is an interactive chatbot designed to collect and learn from user-provided natural language 
responses. Instead of relying on predefined responses, LearniChat continuously expands its knowledge base 
by engaging with users and storing their answers. 
This project aims to gather diverse conversational data to better understand human communication patterns, 
which can later be used for data analysis and AI model training.

How It Works
The chatbot starts with minimal knowledge and learns from every interaction.
If it encounters an unknown question, it asks the user how it should respond.
The user can provide a response, which gets stored in the chatbot’s memory for future conversations.
If a similar question is asked later, LearniChat retrieves the best-matching response.
Users can also refine and expand its responses by teaching alternative replies.

Why This Project?
- Data Collection for NLP Research: 
The chatbot gathers real-world conversational data, which can be used for training sentiment analysis models,
conversational AI, and other NLP applications.
- Understanding Human Communication: 
By analyzing collected responses, we can study how people phrase questions and what types of replies they 
expect.
- Foundation for Future AI Development:
The collected dataset can later be used to train advanced chatbots that offer more natural and
engaging interactions.

Features
- Self-Learning Mechanism – Expands its knowledge base with every interaction.
- Dynamic Response Matching – Finds the closest known question and retrieves a learned response.
- User-Guided Training – Allows users to refine answers or provide multiple responses to the same question.
- Data Storage for Future Analysis – Saves collected conversations in a JSON file for later research and
  AI training.

Contributions are welcome!! I hope all of you can use this ChatBot and provide me with enough data for future 
analysis so I can work towards creating a robust ChatBot that can provide companionship to those that need it.
